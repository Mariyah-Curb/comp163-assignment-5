# comp163-assignment-5

For this assignment I work with trial and error to determine the best use of for and while loops.
I would iniitially start off with FOR loops because infinite loop errors tend to crash my laptop but I used WHILE one good time in the beginning. Thankfully I understood the logic well enough to not cause any crashes.

My 2 other solutions utilize FOR and use the range function to pprecisely excute the code the right amount of times to get the correct output

I used AI gemini twice: Once because I fogot to use the \n and that caused an error and again to recieve clarification on the third part of the assignment to make my rows and columns.
